# Exploration of SWIOSE ensembles with Ocean Parcels

This preliminary work aims at providing basic tests on the Ocean Parcels python module, within the [BRIDGES-AVATAR](https://www.bridges-wio.com/fr/projet/pc-3-avatar/) research project. The idea is to provide a "starter" set of tools to explore the outputs of ocean simulations, namely the newly-developed SWIOSE (SouthWest Indian Ocean Stochastic Ensembles).
